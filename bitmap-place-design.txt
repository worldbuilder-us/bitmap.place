BITMAP.PLACE: A 2D Metaverse implementation

218812.bitmap is a planet with unbounded parcels of land. 
Each parcel of land is an infinite canvas, extending in all directions. 
Each parcel of land is owned by a user, granted by tokens. Access to a parcel of land is 
controlled by the owner, and can be granted to other users using tokens. 

We build: 
1. An implementation of yourworldoftext that allows for each 
parcel to be owned by a user, and for access to be controlled by tokens.
- Using RelayX could be the simplest way to do this
    - Makes it interoperable between BSV and BTC, and allows for easy onboarding
- RelayX handles would be an easy way to, for example, color code each user's text. 

EXAMPLE: bitmap.place/1 , bitmap.place/2 , ... bitmap.place/{x}
Each of these parcels is private, and only accessible to token holders. 

2. A page for users to order a parcel and the amount of tokens for that parcel.
Let us use an example number of 0.001BTC per token. 
- A user may want to purchase a private parcel of land for them and their friends,
so they ask for 10 tokens. 
- A more entrepreneurial user may want a massive engaging club going, and ask for 1000 tokens.
    - The smart enterprising user would see the value in acquiring 1000 tokens and selling 990 of them. 

10 TOKENS x 0.001BTC = 0.01BTC
1000 TOKENS x 0.001BTC = 1BTC
~~~
MULTIPLIED BY UNBOUNDED AMOUNT OF PARCELS

Each parcel is like a private club, and the most advanced version of the metaverse seen thus far. 
It is a timeless canvas, and a place for users to express themselves.
It is as safe as possible, because it is limited to ASCII text. 
It is as private as possible, because it is only accessible to token holders.

## How to run
- We take orders through our form. We communicate directly with customer. 
- We mint unique token for each parcel, ie. Parcel #001 uses TOKEN #001, Parcel #002 uses TOKEN #002, etc.
- We send tokens to customer's RelayX handle.
- User logs into bitmap.place with their RelayX wallet. They can use RelayX to transfer and sell tokens.
- Users now have their own private land in the metaverse, for use however they want. 

This is our minimum viable product.

EXTRA:
- Relay handles can be used to color code text so users are identifiable.
- Pricing can be competitive
